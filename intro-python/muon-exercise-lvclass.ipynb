    "In this exercise we'll take a look at some (simulated) proton-proton collision data.  The events chosen all have at least two reconstructed muons.  If you're not familiar, a muon is a heavy cousin of the electron; see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon) and [here](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2020/tables/rpp2020-sum-leptons.pdf) for some more information.  Some of these events contain (at least) a pair of real muons with opposite electric charge frmo the decay of a Z boson (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons),[here](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2020/listings/rpp2020-list-z-boson.pdf)).  Other events contain one real muon (could have positive or negative charge) from the decay of a W boson (more [here](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2020/listings/rpp2020-list-w-boson.pdf)) and one or more \"fake\" muons of either electric charge.  Here, fake means a lepton that is not from the decay of a W or Z boson.  These are typically from semi-leptonic decays of charm or bottom hadrons or decays in flight of kaons.\n",
